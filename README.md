### Hello Dev!

<br>

## Welcome to mine Chart.js library study! I'm using this repository as a chart template library, so that in the future I don't need to spend time, I just need to implement the data, whether manual or api, all the graphics imported here are now being implemented manually to don't have a risk get an error!

<br>
<p>this repository has almost all types of charts provided by Chart.Js, all are components of Svelte and need to be imported to be used without the need to create them again</p>
<br>
